# Course Title: Introduction to Computer Programming I

# Course Code: CMP 201

## Introduction 
 Introduction to Computer Programming I is a three-credit course first semester. It is a compulsory course for all computer science, software engineering and cyber security in the College of Computing who need to acquire the basic skills in the area of computer programming. 
It deals with the introduction to computer Programming languages. Programming languages are not very different from spoken languages. Learning any language requires an understanding of
the building blocks and the grammar that govern the construction of statements in that
language. The course presents background concepts of objects and describes a widely used programming methodology in object-oriented design (OOD).
In the process of completing the course, students are expected to go through the sections on the lecturer’s page and read each section carefully as well as participate in activities and evaluations. It is also important the students should open and read through all the links provided in each section by clicking on them. The students should also read the recommended textbooks and other materials.

## Course Aim 
The course will introduce you to the concepts of object-oriented programming by using any object-oriented programming language.

## Course Outline 
Introduction to computer programming. Functional programming; Declarative programming; Logic programming; Scripting languages. Introduction to object orientation as a technique for modelling computation. Introduction of a typical object-oriented language, such as Java. Basic data types, variables, expressions, assignment statements and operators. Basic object-oriented concepts: abstraction; objects; classes; methods; parameter passing; encapsulation. Introduction to Strings and string processing; Simple I/O; control structures; Arrays; Simple recursive algorithms; inheritance; polymorphism.
### Lab Work
Programming assignments involving hands-on practice in the design and implementation of simple algorithms such as finding the average, standard deviation, searching and sorting. Practice in developing and tracing simple recursive algorithms. Developing programmes involving inheritance and polymorphism

## Course Objectives

1. understand computer programming, functional, declarative, and logic programming
2. understand scripting languages 
3. describe the object-orientation as a technique for modelling computation
4. understand a typical object-oriented language, such as Java. Basic data types, variables, expressions, assignment statements and operators
5. Basic object-oriented concepts: abstraction; objects; classes; methods; parameter passing; encapsulation
6. understand strings and string processing; Simple I/O; and control structures
7. understand arrays; simple recursive algorithms; inheritance; polymorphism
8. demonstrate practical skills in the knowledge of programming in an object-oriented language involving hands-on practice in the design and implementation of simple algorithms such as finding the average, standard deviation, searching and sorting. Practice in developing and tracing simple recursive algorithms. Developing programmes involving inheritance and polymorphism.
