# Course Title: Database Design and Management

# Course Code: CMP 309

## Introduction 
Database design management is a three-credit course first semester. It is a compulsory course for all computer science, software engineering and cyber security in the department of physical and computer sciences who need to acquire the basic skills in the area of database design and management. This course focuses on information storage, retrieval, management, capturing and representation. It is a course where students will be exposed to Database management systems and basic concepts. The functions and components of DEMS’ file design. The use of database query language. 
In the process of completing the course, students are expected to go through the sections on the lecturer’s page and read each section carefully as well as participate in activities and evaluations. It is also important the students should open and read through all the links provided in each section by clicking on them. The students should also read the recommended textbooks and other materials. 

## Course Aim 
The aim of this course is to introduce students to the basic knowledge of database design and management. This will entail a thorough idea of the application of database management systems which are important factors for computing professionals. This course offers the student the opportunity of the study of information storage, retrieval, capture and representation.  A good knowledge of this course content will guide the student in the process of database design and management.
