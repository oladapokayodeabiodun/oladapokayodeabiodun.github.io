# Course Title: Database Design and Management

# Course Code: CMP 309

## Introduction 
Database design management is a three-credit course first semester. It is a compulsory course for all computer science, software engineering and cyber security in the department of physical and computer sciences who need to acquire the basic skills in the area of database design and management. This course focuses on information storage, retrieval, management, capturing and representation. It is a course where students will be exposed to Database management systems and basic concepts. The functions and components of DEMS’ file design. The use of database query language. 
In the process of completing the course, students are expected to go through the sections on the lecturer’s page and read each section carefully as well as participate in activities and evaluations. It is also important the students should open and read through all the links provided in each section by clicking on them. The students should also read the recommended textbooks and other materials. 

## Course Aim 
The aim of this course is to introduce students to the basic knowledge of database design and management. This will entail a thorough idea of the application of database management systems which are important factors for computing professionals. This course offers the student the opportunity of the study of information storage, retrieval, capture and representation.  A good knowledge of this course content will guide the student in the process of database design and management. 

## Course Outline 
Information Storage and Retrieval, Information Management Application, Information Capture and Representation, Analysis and Indexing, Search, Retrieval, Information Privacy, Integrity, Scalability, Efficiency and Effectiveness. 
Database Management Systems, Review of Basic Concepts, Function and Components of DBMS, File Design and Access Path: Future Direction in DBMS, Use of Database query language

### Week 2:	Information Storage and Retrieval [Click to access the Week Two Slide](https://youtu.be/QbMo7LJfCt4)
* Computers and data processing techniques have made possible the high-speed, selective retrieval of large amounts of information from various quarters. 
* The term information storage and retrieval indicates the system used for organizing knowledge for subject retrieval.
* information storage and retrieval, the systematic process of collecting and classifying data so that they can be located and displayed on request. 
* Information retrieval is the process of recovering a specific piece of information from stored data
* There are several basic types of information storage and retrieval systems. 
Document-retrieval systems store entire documents, which are usually retrieved by title or by keywords associated with the document. 
In some systems, the text of documents is stored as data. This permits full-text searching, enabling retrieval on the basis of any words in the document. 
In others, a digitized image of the document is stored, usually on a write-once optical disc. 
Database systems store the information as a series of discrete records that are, in turn, divided into discrete fields (e.g., name, address, and phone number); records can be searched and retrieved on the basis of the content of the fields (e.g., all people who have a particular telephone area code). 
The data are stored within the computer, either in main storage or auxiliary storage, for ready access. The storage of information, once only on the hard drives of computers with large processing capacity, now takes place in a unique way, so that it is possible to access files, data, and applications anywhere and anytime, using either a computer or mobile devices, provided there is an Internet connection, through storage in the so-called "clouds".

**Information Retrieval Process** 


Any information storage and retrieval system will have a complex series of operations before documentary information can be used: 
1. Information must be recorded in documents; 
2. Each document must be stored with others in some accessible place and its location known; 
3. Characteristic aspects of each document profile, and this must be recorded with others in the same file; 
4. The potential user must formulate some query or express some interest in terms of characteristics recorded about documents; 
5. This user profile must be compared with document profiles and the locations of matching documents identified; 
6. The documents must be located and presented to the user
