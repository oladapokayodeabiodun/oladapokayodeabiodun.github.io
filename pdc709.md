# Course Title: Object Oriented Programming

# Course Code: PDC 709

## Introduction 
Object-oriented programming is a three-credit course first semester. It is a compulsory course for all postgraduate diploma computer science students in the department of computer science. 
The course presents background concepts of objects and describes a widely used programming methodology in object-oriented design (OOD). This course is aimed at enhancing your former knowledge in programming by introducing objects to improve your knowledge in writing programs through the possible use of objects and classes.
In the process of completing the course, students are expected to go through the sections on the lecturer’s page and read each section carefully as well as participate in activities and evaluations. It is also important the students should open and read through all the links provided in each section by clicking on them. The students should also read the recommended textbooks and other materials.

## Course Aim 
The course will introduce you to the concepts of object-oriented programming by using any object-oriented programming language.

## Course Outline 
The basic concept of object-oriented programming (OOP); study of the features of a common OOP language such as Java, C++, and the like; exception handling; introduction to object-oriented design; implementing common data structures; application of OOP in the development of systems and application software; class libraries and frameworks.

## Course Objectives 
After completing the course successfully, the student should be able to:
1. explain the basic object-oriented programming concepts
2. describe the features of a common OOP language
3. explain exception handling 
4. understand object-oriented design
5. implement common data structures 
6. demonstrate practical skills in the knowledge of programming in an object-oriented language.
