# Course Title: Advanced Programming Techniques

# Course Code: CMP 809

## Introduction 
This is a three-credit unit course offered by the 800-level students of the degree programme in Computer Science. Advanced Programming Techniques provides programming and system design ideas that transcend any programming language. 
The overall aim of CMP 809 is to expose the student to learning that programming is not just coding but a mixed bag of different methods to improve the efficiency of finding a solution. In this course content you will find useful details about this course, its aims and objectives, what the course is all about, course materials to be used, available services in support of this course, and details on assignments and examinations. You should check regularly for updates. I wish you all the best in your learning and completing this course.  

## Course Aim 
This course aims to introduce the students to advanced programming techniques with the hope that the knowledge will help in solving some real-world problems. 

## Course Outline 
-	Review of different programming paradigms. 
-	Evaluation of programming languages (readability, writeability and reliability). 
-	Structured programming, Event-driven programming, Concurrent programming.  
-	In-depth study of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
-	Program design using UML.  
-	Programming computers in an OOP language environment using Java.  
-	Special applications of Java in database and web programs.  
-	Survey of other OOP language environments such as C++, PHP, etc.

## Course Objectives 
After completing the course successfully, the student should be able to:
1. Explain the different programming paradigms
2. Evaluate programming languages
3. Describe structured programming
4. Understand Object Oriented Programming
5. Understand Program design in Unified Modelling Language
6. Understand OOP Language using an agreed Programming language
7. Understand the special application of the agreed programming language in database and web program
8. Describe the survey of other OOP language environments
