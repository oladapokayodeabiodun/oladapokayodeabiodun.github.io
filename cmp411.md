# Course Title: Algorithm And Complexity Analysis 

# Course Code: CMP 411

## Introduction 
This is a three-credit unit course offered by the 400-level students of the degree programme in Cybersecurity, Information Technology, Software Engineering and Computer Science. An algorithm is a step-by-step process of solving a problem while the complexity of an algorithm is the cost, measure in running time, storage or whatever relevant units of using the algorithm in solving one of those problems. 
The overall aim of CMP 411 is about the methods for solving problems on computers and the costs (running time, storage) of using those methods. In this course content you will find useful details about this course, its aims and objectives, what the course is all about, course materials to be used, available services in support of this course, and details on assignments and examinations. I strongly recommend you check regularly for updates. I wish you all the best in your learning and the successful completion of this course.  

## Course Aim 
The aim of this course is to introduce the students to how to design and test algorithms and also help them identify various types of algorithm design paradigms.
