Artificial Intelligence is a branch of science which deals with helping machines find solutions to complex problems in a more human-like fashion. This generally involves borrowing characteristics from human intelligence and applying them as algorithms in a computer-friendly way. A more or less flexible or efficient approach can be taken depending on the requirements established, which influences how artificial the intelligent behaviour appears.

Different researchers have different scopes and views of artificial intelligence:  
1.	AI is about designing systems that are as intelligent as humans. 
2.	The idea of the Turing Test 
3.	Logic and Laws of thoughts 
4.	Study of Rational Agents 

* **History of AI (Slides)** 


The idea of 'a machine that thinks' dates back to ancient Greece. But since the advent of electronic computing, important events and milestones in the evolution of artificial intelligence include the following:
+	1950: Alan Turing publishes Computing Machinery and Intelligence. In the paper, Turing—famous for breaking the Nazi's ENIGMA code during WWII—proposes to answer the question 'Can machines think?' and introduces the Turing Test to determine if a computer can demonstrate the same intelligence (or the results of the same intelligence) as a human. The value of the Turing test has been debated ever since.
+	1956: John McCarthy coined the term 'artificial intelligence' at the first-ever AI conference at Dartmouth College. (McCarthy would go on to invent the Lisp language.) Later that year, Allen Newell, J.C. Shaw, and Herbert Simon created the Logic Theorist, the first-ever running AI software program.
+	1967: Frank Rosenblatt builds the Mark 1 Perceptron, the first computer based on a neural network that 'learned' through trial and error. Just a year later, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published a book titled Perceptrons, which became both the landmark work on neural networks and, at least for a while, an argument against future neural network research projects.
+	1980s: Neural networks which use a backpropagation algorithm to train itself become widely used in AI applications.
+	1997: IBM's Deep Blue beats then world chess champion Garry Kasparov, in a chess match (and rematch).
+	2011: IBM Watson beats champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter at Jeopardy!
+	2015: Baidu's Minwa supercomputer uses a special kind of deep neural network called a convolutional neural network to identify and categorize images with a higher rate of accuracy than the average human.
+	2016: DeepMind's AlphaGo program, powered by a deep neural network, beats Lee Sodol, the world champion Go player, in a five-game match. The victory is significant given the huge number of possible moves as the game progresses (over 14.5 trillion after just four moves!). Later, Google purchased DeepMind for a reported USD 400 million.
+	2023: A rise in large language models, or LLMs, such as ChatGPT, creates an enormous change in the performance of AI and its potential to drive enterprise value. With these new generative AI practices, deep-learning models can be pre-trained on vast amounts of raw, unlabeled data.

* **Goals of AI** 

The main goals of AI are:
1.	Imitating the human intelligence 
2.	Solving high skills tasks
3.	Intelligent link between action and insight 
4.	Design a machine or device that can perform jobs that require human knowledge 
5.	Systems that exhibit intelligent behaviour and learn new things by themselves 

* **AI Technique**

Artificial Intelligence research during the last three decades has concluded that Intelligence requires knowledge. To compensate for overwhelming quality, knowledge possesses less desirable properties. 
+ It is huge. 
+ It is difficult to characterize correctly. 
+ It is constantly varying. 
+ It differs from data by being organized in a way that corresponds to its application. 
+ It is complicated.

An AI technique is a method that exploits knowledge that is represented so that: 


* The knowledge captures generalizations that share properties, and are grouped together, rather than being allowed separate representation. 
* It can be understood by people who must provide it—even though for many programs bulk of the data comes automatically from readings. 
* In many AI domains, how people understand the same people must supply the knowledge to a program. 
* It can be easily modified to correct errors and reflect changes in real conditions. 
* It can be widely used even if it is incomplete or inaccurate. 
* It can be used to help overcome its own sheer bulk by helping to narrow the range of possibilities that must be usually considered. 

The programs increase in complexity, their use of generalizations, the clarity of their knowledge and the extensibility of their approach. In this way, they move towards being representations of AI techniques.

* **Branches and applications of AI** 

* Branches 
A list of branches of AI is given below.
  *	Logical AI
