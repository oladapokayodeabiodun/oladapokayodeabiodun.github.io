# Course Title: Database Management System

# Course Code: PDC 711

## Introduction 
The database management system is a three-credit course first semester. It is a compulsory course for all postgraduate diploma computer science students in the department of computer science. 
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a group of software programs that organise, store, manage, and retrieve data in a database. It is a collection of prewritten programs for storing, updating, and retrieving a database. The database management system (DBMS) accepts data requests from the application program and advises the operating system to send them. Using a database management system (DBMS) allows for easier changes to information systems in response to changing organisational needs. New kinds of data can be added to the database without disrupting the present system. Organisations may use one sort of DBMS for everyday transaction processing and then shift the detail onto another machine that utilises a different DBMS better suited for random inquiries and analysis. Overall systems design decisions are performed by data administrators and systems analysts. Detailed database design is performed by database administrators. 
In the process of completing the course, students are expected to go through the sections on the lecturer’s page and read each section carefully as well as participate in activities and evaluations. It is also important the students should open and read through all the links provided in each section by clicking on them. The students should also read the recommended textbooks and other materials.

## Course Aim 
The course will allow you to develop background knowledge as well as core expertise in Database Management Systems.

## Course Outline 
Basic database concepts. Conceptual modeling. Relational data model. Relational theory and languages. Database Design. Database security and integrity. Introduction to query processing and optimization. Introduction to concurrency and recovery. Suggested Lab work:
Programming assignments to learn database design using CASE tools. Introduction to back-end/Server-based Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). Learning Standard SQL (interactive/embedded). Introduction and programming assignments on Front-End tools. Programming team projects to design and develop real-life database systems using the learned tools. 

## Course Objectives 
After completing the course successfully, the student should be able to:
1. explain the basic database concepts
2. describe the conceptual modelling and relational data model
3. explain relational theory and languages
4. understand query processing and optimization
5. understand concurrency and recovery 
6. demonstrate practical skills in learning database design
